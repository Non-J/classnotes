## Scala

Case class is equivalent to C#'s Record or Kotlin's Data Class. They are class whose main functionality is to organize the contained value.

Sealed trait is a trait that can only be implemented within the file that defined them. If a case class implement a sealed trait, we get Algebraic Data Type, which is use equivalently to Rust's enum.

## Identifiers

- Binding occurrence: relates identifier to an entity.
- Bound occurrence: the identifier is used to use the entity.
- Free identifier: neither binding or bound.
