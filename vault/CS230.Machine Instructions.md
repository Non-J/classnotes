## Basic of x86

### Registers

- Instruction Pointer: RIP (next instruction to execute)
- General Purpose: RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, RSP, RBP, R8-R15

Note: There are various counterparts to these registers that access the lower bits. For example: EAX is 32 lower bits of RAX.

### x86 Calling Convention (Unix Systems)

Arguments 1-6: RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9

Floating Point Arguments 1-8:  XMM0-XMM7

Excess Arguments: Stack

Return: RAX

RBX, RSP, RBP, and R12â€“R15 are callee-saved. Others are caller-saved.

### Syntaxes

|               | Intel                                       | AT&T                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Immediates    | 10                                          | $10                                          |
| Registers     | RAX                                         | %RAX                                         |
| Memory        | [base + index * scale + disp]              | disp(base,index,scale)                       |
| Operand Order | instruction dest src                        | instruction src dest                         |
| Operand Size  | Memory prefix: byte, word, dword, qword ptr | Instruction suffix: b, w, l, q (=8,16,32,64) |

Note: disp can be 1, 2, 4. scale can be 1, 2, 4, 8.

Note: CS230 uses AT&T syntax.

### Condition Codes

- ZF: Zero flag, result is zero
- CF: Carry flag, unsigned overflow
- SF: Sign flag, signed arithmetic resulted in negative
- OF: Overflow flag, signed arithmetic overflowed

Flags may be set implicitly by arithmetic instructions. May also be set explicitly by compare instructions like [cmp](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/cmp) and [test](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/test).

Flags may by explicitly read by [SETcc instructions](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/setcc). Only one byte is set, others are untouched.

To use these as conditions, the [Jcc instructions](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/jcc) offers conditional jumps.

Note: For Intel syntax, the comparison order follows the operand order:

```asm
test(long):                               # @test(long)
        xor     eax, eax
        cmp     rdi, 16
        setge   al
        ret
```

Thus, this function returns true if input is greater than or equals to 16.

### Stack

Grows down (towards lower addresses). Top of the stack pointed to by RSP. The beginning of the current stack frame is pointed to by RBP.

To call a function:

- Use [push](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/push) and [pop](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pop) instructions to save register values and load them later.
- Set up the arguments into appropriate registers. Excess arguments are put on stacks.
- Use [call](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/call) and [ret](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/ret) instructions to call the actual procedure.
  - The instructions stores the return address onto the stack.
  
Linux stack frame:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan=2>Caller Frame</th>
            <th colspan=2>Callee Frame</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Excess Arguments (7th, 8th, ...)</td>
            <td>Return Address</td>
            <td>Saved Registers (e.g., old frame pointer)</td>
            <td>Locals Variables</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>RBP + 0x10 + ...</td>
            <td>RBP + 0x08</td>
            <td>RBP</td>
            <td>RBP - ...</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Note: There may be some alignment/paddings.

Note: From experimentation, it seems that register-passed arguments are copied into the stack as if it is local variables, at least in debug mode. With optimization, it won't if it can get away with not having to do that.

Note: Even though RSP is supposed to be decremented to expand the stack, on Linux, 128 bytes beyond RSP is reserved, thus local variables may just use them without actually setting RSP properly.
