## Two's Complement Integers

For $i$ bits signed integers in two's complement, the most significant bit has value of $-2^{i-1}$. Otherwise, it is treated as usual.

This gives the range of $[-2^{i-1},\,2^{i-1}-1]$.

Nice wrapping properties where integer overflow wraps to negative. And by nice I mean massively unsafe.

### Sign extension

To extend integers to larger size (but keep the same value), copies the most significant bit to fill in the new space.

### Note on bit shift

Logical right shift fills new bits with zero where as arithmetic right shift copies the most significant bit. C uses logical shift for unsigned and arithmetic shift for signed.

Ostensibly, left shift on signed integers is UB in C.

## Floating Points

Binary significant figures.

| Precision   | Sign/Exp/Frac | Normalized              | De-normalized          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 16 (Half)   | 1/5/10        | $(-1)^s(1.M)2^{E-15}$   | $(-1)^s(0.M)2^{-14}$   |
| 32 (Single) | 1/8/23        | $(-1)^s(1.M)2^{E-127}$  | $(-1)^s(0.M)2^{-126}$  |
| 64 (Double) | 1/11/52       | $(-1)^s(1.M)2^{E-1023}$ | $(-1)^s(0.M)2^{-1022}$ |

De-normalized values are values whose $E=0$.

### Special Values

- Infinity is when Exp is all ones and Frac is all zeros.
- NaN is when Exp is all ones and Frac is not all zeros.

### Rounding

- Round to nearest, prefer even if half-way (Default)
- Towards zero
- Round down towards $-\infty$
- Round up towards $+\infty$
