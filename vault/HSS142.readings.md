## The Clash of Civilization (Samuel P. Huntington)

- Core concept: Because cultural (and other factors) differences among civilization (not necessary defined along nation state boundary), conflicts are inevitable as these cultural differences are unlikely to go away in near future
- The document goes on the list supporting details
- Document is a bit outdated (from 1993!)
- Having a hard time evaluating whether it is still accurate in 2022. Admittedly my limited knowledge can only carry me so far

## Dialogue of Civilizations (United Nations University)

- Opinion: Appeal to human universality might not work for a variety of reasons. E.g., some culture may not value diversity or acceptance of others. Potentially a source of conflict if the other civilization doesn't accept this
- Culture and civilization is not static!!!
- The document goes on to list what each people (who already holds this value) can do to foster them
