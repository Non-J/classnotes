## Arc Length

Let function $r(t: \R): \R^3$ be a path (arc) in 3D space.

The arc length is found by integrating the speed over time:

$$
\int_{t_{start}}^{t_{end}}|r'(t)|dt
$$

Define the function of distance so far as:

$$
s(t)=\int_0^t|r'(\tau)|d\tau
$$

The corresponding inverse function, of elapsed time at distance, can be found since the function $s(t)$ is an increasing function (except at $t=0$):

$$
t(s)
$$

Thus, we can have a function that takes in arc length and returns position in 3D space:

$$
\~{r}(s)=r(t(s))
$$

```mermaid
flowchart LR
 s("Distance/Arc length, [0, L]")
 t("Time/Parameter, [0, T]")
 r("Position, RÂ³")
 t -- "s(t)" --> s
 s -- "t(s)" --> t
 t -- "r(t)" --> r
 s -- "r(t(s))" --> r
```

Unit tangent vector is defined as:

$$
T(t)=\frac{r'(t)}{|r'(t)|}
$$

$$
\~{T}(s)=\frac{d}{ds}\~{r}(s)=\~{T}(s(t))
$$

Then, we get curvature as:

$$
\~{\Kappa}(s)=|\frac{d}{ds}\~{T}(s)|=|\frac{d}{dt}T(t)|\frac{1}{|r'(t)|}
$$

> Note: For a circle of radius $R$, the curvature is $1/R$.

### Dependency on Parameterization

Consider arcs that are defined differently (using different parameterization), but have the exact same shape. Some properties are only dependent on the shape and are independent on parameterization, such as tangent vector $T(t)$. Some properties are also dependent on parameterization, such as velocity $r'(t)$.

## TNB Frame and Coordinate System

Coordinate system consisting T(s), N(s), B(s); which are unit tangent vector, principal unit normal vector, and binormal unit vector.

$$
T(s)=r'(s)\quad N(s)=\frac{T'(s)}{|T'(s)|}\quad B(s)=T(s)\times N(s)
$$

> Note: $K(s)=T'(s)=r''(s)$ indicates the "force" if the particle is pulled some kind of gravitational field from a mass. This is related to curvature, a scalar value, by $\Kappa(s)=|K(s)|$.

This system is defined on arc length $s$, so this system will fail if:

1. the particle stops moving at some point: $|r'(t)|\neq0$
2. the particle must always be curving: $\Kappa(s)\neq0$

### Binormal

$$
B'(s)=-\tau(s)N(s)
$$

where $\tau(s)$ is a scalar real value called "torsion", which describes how the plane formed by $T$ and $N$ is twisting.

> Note: The minus sign in this equation is by convention.

### Defined on parameter $t$

For property $F$, we can:

$$
F_s'(s)=F_t'(t(s))=F_t'(t)\frac{dt}{ds}=F_t'(t)\frac{1}{|r'(t)|}
$$

The TNB frame on parameter $t$:

$$
T(t)=\frac{r'(t)}{|r'(t)|}\quad N(t)=\frac{T'(t)}{|T'(t)|}\quad B(s)=T(s)\times N(s)
$$

$$
K(t)=\frac{T'(t)}{|r'(t)|}\quad \tau(t)=-\frac{1}{|r'(t)|}B'(t)\cdot N(t)
$$

### Summary

$$
T=\frac{v}{|v|}\quad N=\frac{T'}{|T'|}\quad B=T\times N
$$

$$
\tau=-\frac{dB}{ds}N
$$

$$
K=\frac{dT}{ds}=\frac{T'}{|v|}\quad \kappa=|K|=\frac{1}{\text{R}}
$$

$$
a_T=\frac{d|v|}{dt}\quad a_N=\frac{|v|^2}{R}=\kappa |v|^2
$$

## Polar Coordinates

Define the basis vectors as:

$$
\hat r=\cos(\theta)\hat i+\sin(\theta)\hat j\qquad \hat \theta=-\sin(\theta)\hat i+\cos(\theta)\hat j
$$

Using this system, any position $x$ can be denoted as $x=r\hat r$ for any radius $r$ from origin. Since $\hat r$ rotates to follow $\theta$, there is no need to encode $\theta$ separately.

Velocity and acceleration can be obtained directly using derivatives:

$$
v=\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dr}{dt}\hat r+\frac{d\hat r}{dt}r=\frac{dr}{d\theta}\frac{d\theta}{dt}\hat r+\frac{d\hat r}{d\theta}\frac{d\theta}{dt}r=\frac{dr}{d\theta}\dot\theta\hat r+\hat\theta\dot\theta r
$$

$$
a=\dot v=\dots
$$

## Matrix Multiplication

> Note: The notation $(x_1;\,x_2;\,x_3;\,\ldots;\,x_n)$ indicates column vectors. This is the default shape for vectors.

Define $T:\R^n\rarr\R^m$ is linear function if $T(ax+by)=aT(x)+bT(y)$.

Then: $T(\bm{0})=\bm{0}$.

If linear function is given, there always exists an equivalent matrix: $Ax=T(x)$.

The transformation defined using matrix, such as $T(x)=Ax$, is always linear.

### Products

Inner product (or Dot product) for $x,\,y\in\R^n$:

$$
x\cdot y=(x^T)(y)=\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i
$$

Outer product (or Tensor product) for $x\in\R^n,\,y\in\R^m$:

$$
x\otimes y=(x)(y^T)
$$

By putting $x$ as the leftmost column and $y$ as the topmost row and each cell is the multiplication of the leftmost column and topmost row, the tensor product is obtained from the resulting table.

### Matrix Multiplication by Component

$A\times B=C$, where $C_{i,k}=A_{i,*}\cdot B_{*,k}$

### Matrix Multiplication by Column Vector

Given a matrix $A$ and a vector $x$:

$$
Ax=x_1A_{*,1}+x_2A_{*,2}+\ldots+x_nA_{*,n}
$$

So, now consider $A\in\R^{m\times n},\,B\in\R^{n\times l}$:

$$
AB=A(B_{*,1},B_{*,2},\ldots,B_{*,l})=(AB_{*,1},AB_{*,2},\ldots,AB_{*,l})=(C_{*,1},C_{*,2},\ldots,C_{*,3})
$$

Matrix multiplication can be seen as many multiplication of column vectors by breaking down $B$ into individual column vectors.

### Matrix Multiplication by Row Vector

$$
AB=\begin{pmatrix} A_{1,*} \\ A_{2,*} \\ \vdots \\ A_{m,*} \end{pmatrix}B=\begin{pmatrix} A_{1,*}B \\ A_{2,*}B \\ \vdots \\ A_{m,*}B \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} C_{1,*} \\ C_{2,*} \\ \vdots \\ C_{m,*} \end{pmatrix}
$$

Matrix multiplication can be seen as many multiplication of row vectors by breaking down $B$ into individual row vectors.

### Matrix Multiplication by Tensor Product

[[Usual matrix multiplication|MAS102.Basics#matrix-multiplication-by-component]] is done row-by-col. But what if we take the tensor product by doing col-by-row:

$$
AB=(A_{*,1},A_{*,2},\ldots,A_{*,n})\begin{pmatrix} B_{1,*} \\ B_{2,*} \\ \vdots \\ B_{m,*} \end{pmatrix}=\sum_{j=1}^nA_{*,j}\otimes B_{j,*}
$$

## Multi-variable Vector-valued Function

### Shape

Defined an open ball as:

$$
B(c,r)=\{x\in\R^n;|x-c|<r\}
$$

Given a body $D$ and a point $c$, there are three cases:

- Interior point when there exists $r>0$ and $B(c,r)\subset D$
- Exterior point when there exists $r>0$ and $|B(c,r)\cap D|=0$
- Boundary point otherwise

$D$ is an open set if there is no boundary point. The opposite is called closed set.

$B(c,r)$ is an open set because the condition is $|x-c|<r$, thus it doesn't have a boundary.

### Graph, Image, Level Set, and Contour

Graph of $f: \R^n\rarr \R^m$ is an object in $\R^{n+m}$ space.

Level set of $f:\R^n\rarr\R$ where $f(x)$ equals to some constant, usually $\R^{n-1}$ object. Example: ${x\in\R^n;f(x)=0}$ is a zero level set.

Contour is a collection of level set. Example: contour lines.

### Limit and Continuity

$L\in\R^m$ is the limit of $f(x\to c):\R^n\rarr\R^m$ exactly when $\forall(\epsilon>0)\exist(\delta>0)(|f(x)-L|<\epsilon\land|x-c|<\delta)$.

$f$ is continuous at $c$ if $f(c)=lim_{x\to c}(f(x))$

### Differentials

Directional Derivative: grab a line and apply derivative as if it is a scalar function.

> Note: Directional continuity in all direction doesn't imply function continuity.

Partial Derivation: the usual one using $\partial$. Specialization of Directional Derivative.

Gradient: for $f:\R^n\to\R^m$: $\nabla f(c)=(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1},\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2},\ldots,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}):\R^{m\times n}$

Full Derivation: Find linear $T:\R^n\to\R^m$ which approximates $f:\R^n\to\R^m$ at limit at some point $c$. If $T$ is found, it is called *differentiable*, and come with the properties:

- $f$ is directionally differentiable
- $T=\nabla f(c)$

The full detail is: $\forall(\epsilon>0)\exist(\delta>0)(|f(x)-(f(c)+T(x-c))|<\epsilon|x-c|\land|x-c|<\delta)$

If $f$ is directionally differentiable and $\nabla f(c)$ is continuous at $c$, then $f(c)$ is fully differentiable and $T=\nabla f(c)$

## Generalized Chain Rule

For differentiable $f$ and $g$ at $c$:

$$
\nabla(f(g(c)))=(\nabla f(g(c)))(\nabla g(c))
$$

So:

$$
\frac{df}{dt}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\frac{dz}{dt}
$$

### Directional Derivative

Given $f:\R^n\to\R^m$ be differentiable at $c\in\R^n$, and $\hat{u}\in\R^n$:

$$
\text{D}_{\hat{u}}f(c)=\nabla f(c)\cdot\hat{u}
$$

Output is in $\R^m$.

## Extremum and Saddle Point

Local extremum is a point where there is not other point in open ball $B(c,r)$ greater/lesser than this one for any arbitrarily small radius.

Critical point is a point where $\nabla f(x)=0$ (or it doesn't exist).

Saddle point is a critical point but not extremum.

Hessian is the second order derivative. For $f:\R^2\to\R$:

$$
\text Hf=\begin{pmatrix} f_{xx} & f_{yx} \\ f_{xy} & f_{xx} \end{pmatrix}
$$

The determinant of Hessian matrix is $f_{xx}f_{yy}-f^2_{xy}$:

- If its value at critical point is negative, it is a saddle point.
- If its value at critical point is positive and $f_{xx}$ or $f_{yy}$ is positive, it is local minimum.
- If its value at critical point is positive and $f_{xx}$ or $f_{yy}$ is negative, it is local maximum.

### Lagrange Multiplier Method

When given a function $f$ to optimize, but restricted to only when $g$ equals a certain value, find the point where:

$$
\nabla f=\lambda\nabla g
$$

and also satisfies the constraint set by $g$. The $\lambda$ is a constant called *Lagrange Multiplier*.

The key insight is into how this works is that when the value of $f$ should be as big (or small) as possible, the contour surface of $f$ should barely graze the contour surface of $g$. Thus, the gradient of $f$ and $g$ should be in the same direction.

Extend for multiple constraints:

$$
\nabla f=\lambda_1\nabla g_1+\lambda_2\nabla g_2+\ldots
$$
