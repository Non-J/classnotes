2) The wave solution magnetic field is given by $\vec{B}=B_0\cos(kx+\omega t)\hat{j}$, where $B_0=5.0\times10^{-10}\ \text{T}$ and $k=3.14\times10^{-2}\ \text{m}^{-1}$.

- Write down $\vec{S}$ from the given magnetic field.
  $$
  \vec{S}=\frac{1}{\mu_0}\vec{E}\times\vec{B}=\frac{1}{\mu_0}cB_0^2\hat{i}=5.96418\times10^5\hat{i}\ \text{W/m}^2
  $$

- Why the percentage of energy density stored in magnetic field equals to the percentage of energy density stored in electric field.

  The energy density of electric and magnetic field is $\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0E^2$ and $\frac{1}{2\mu_0}B^2$ respectively. By using $c^2=\frac{1}{\epsilon_0\mu_0}$ and $E=cB$, we can get that the two energy density equations are the same, meaning that both electric and magnetic field stores the same amount of energy per volume.
