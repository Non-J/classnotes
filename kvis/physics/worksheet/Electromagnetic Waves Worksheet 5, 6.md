# Electromagnetic Waves Worksheet 5, 6

1\. Two cavity radiators are constructed with walls made of diﬀerent material. At the same temperature, how would their radiation spectra diﬀer?

​	A cavity radiators, in theory, mimics the behavior of a black body which is the same regardless of the material. In practice, if a material inside the cavity is highly reflective and absorb little electromagnetic waves, there may be more light reflected out hat expected.

2\. A black body is an ideal system that absorbs 100% of the light incident upon it and emits 100% of the radiation it generate.

3\. Objects at room temperature emit most of its electromagnetic radiation in the infrared range, which is not visible to human without using tools. What little visible light it emits is also invisible as our eyes are not sensitive enough.

5\. 
$$
\frac{A_1}{A_2}=\frac{\sigma T_1^4}{\sigma T_2^4}=\frac{(300.15\text{ K})^4}{(600.15\text{ K})^4}\approx6.25625\times10^{-2}
$$
6\.

From the peak emission wavelength $\lambda_\text{max}\approx1100\text{ nm}$, we can find the temperature via Wien’s Displacement Law:
$$
T\approx\frac{2.898\times10^{-3}}{\lambda_\text{max}}\approx2634.34\text{ K}
$$
From there, we can calculate the total intensity via Stefan’s Law assuming that tungsten filament is a perfect black body:
$$
I=\sigma T^4\approx2.73085\times10^6\text{ W/m}^2
$$

###### In-class Activities

- Light induces positive charge on a thin conductive plate

- The action is sensitive to wavelength, as shown when some of the wavelength is blocked by a glass plate

  Light intensity has no effect on electron’s velocity emitted from photoelectric effect.
